This is HTML code for a badge generation project for employees of a fictional company called KnAi. The form includes fields to select an image, enter the employee's name, age, profession and CPF. When the form is submitted, the script prevents the default behavior of reloading the page, checks whether all fields are filled in, and if so, caches the data in the browser using localStorage. Then the page is redirected to the cracha-result.html.

The idea of ​​the project is to provide a simple and effective way to generate badges for a company's employees. The form includes fields to enter important information that must be displayed on the badge, such as the employee's name, age, profession and CPF. Additionally, the form includes a field to select an image, which can be a photo of the employee.

When the form is submitted, the script checks whether all fields are filled in and, if so, caches the data in the browser using localStorage. The page is then redirected to the page cracha-result.html, where the cached data can be used to generate the badge.

This is just one example of how the project can be implemented. The page cracha-result.htmlstill needs to be created and the script that generates the badge still needs to be written. However, this code provides a solid foundation for the project, which can be easily customized and expanded to meet your company's specific needs.
